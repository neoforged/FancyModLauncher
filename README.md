# FoxLauncher

This will be the installed component for running NeoForge as a "regular" mod. It should replace all the -installer tasks in the current neo installer, and allow loading neo as a mod from the "mods folder" - or other locator.

We need to think how this change will affect userdev and neodev as well.

It currently contains the old "FMLOnly" piece - which is going to be the basis of this exercise.
